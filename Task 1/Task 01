[1] Introduction to containerization and Docker fundamentals, Basic Commands


1. What is Containerization?

Containerization is a lightweight form of virtualization that allows applications to run in isolated environments called containers.

Unlike virtual machines, containers share the host operating system kernel, making them faster and more efficient.

Benefits of containerization:

Portability (run anywhere)

Scalability

Efficiency

Easy deployment

ğŸ“Œ 2. Introduction to Docker

Docker is the most popular containerization platform.

It helps developers package applications with all dependencies into a single container image.

Containers ensure consistency across development, testing, and production environments.

ğŸ“Œ 3. Basic Docker Commands
ğŸ”¹ Docker Version & Info
docker --version
docker info

ğŸ”¹ Pull an Image
docker pull ubuntu

ğŸ”¹ Run a Container
docker run -it ubuntu

ğŸ”¹ List Containers
docker ps            # running containers
docker ps -a         # all containers

ğŸ”¹ List Images
docker images

ğŸ”¹ Stop & Remove Container
docker stop <container_id>
docker rm <container_id>

ğŸ”¹ Remove Image
docker rmi <image_id>

ğŸ”¹ Build Image from Dockerfile
docker build -t myapp .

ğŸ”¹ Run Container with Port Mapping
docker run -d -p 8080:80 myapp
